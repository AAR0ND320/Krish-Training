# Missing Number Problem
This project was created for solving the coding challenge of finding a missing number from a given sequence. The algorithm had to satisfy the following conditions:
  1. Sequences will be taken as an input from a user.
  2. Should take unordered sequences.
  3. Specify a de-limiter for the user to separate numbers.
  4. Only allow the specified de-limiter to be used.
  5. The missing number should be output to the user.

The following assumptions can be made:
  1. The sequence should always follow a consecutive (n + 1) pattern.
  2. There will always be a missing number.
  3. Missing number can be in the beginning or end of the sequence as well.

## Dealing with Assumption 3
The third assumption suggests that the missing number from the sequence could be at the beginning or the end of the sequence as well. This makes this problem more complicated since it would be difficult to try to automatically assume where the missing number would be placed.
